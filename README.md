⚠️README!⚠️

> This project basically conducts a draw, randomly showing the selected secret friends! :D

## ❗About the Project

This project was developed during the Alura course for the Oracle Next Education program - ONE (8th Group). The script aims to generate names randomly for a Secret Friend game.

## ⚙️ Script Workflow

> These are the steps (instructions) and the logic of the algorithm as they appear in the "app.js" file:

- [X] Function implemented to add friends;
- [X] Function coupled with the previous one that performs a check to prevent invalid names (with numbers, special characters, etc.) or duplicate names from being added more than once;
- [X] Function implemented to randomly select friends from the list;
- [X] Function implemented to update the list of friends;
- [X] Function developed to ensure the same name is selected only once;
- [X] Function developed to automatically clear the input field entered by the user;
- [X] Function developed to create a new instance of the draw.
